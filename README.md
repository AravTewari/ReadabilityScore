# ReadabilityScore
Code which will analyze a piece of text and return a readability score based on different grading levels such as the Automated Readability Index and the Flesch-Kincaid readability test. The code will look at the text and extract the number of words and sentences using regexs and calculate the number of syllables by looking at the number of vowels and number of polysyllables. It will then use this information and plug it into a formula, and output the score and the estimated age group which could read the text. Text can be imported, as well.
